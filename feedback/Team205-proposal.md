 * This project seems really similar to the Grumblr app, with the addition of transactions and some GPS functionality. As of right now the scope is a bit too small for a group of three members, and if you want to continue on with this idea you'll have to find some way of elevating the app.

 * This app sounds pretty much like Grumblr but with meals instead of posts. Even with the adding chat box and payment system, I don't think the project is scoped well for a 3-person group. There is a lot of stuff you could add to this like food-related APIs or location-based APIs. You should try to make your app innovative or add a component which really differentiates it more from Grumblr.

 * I'm a bit concerned because this project is a bit too similar to Grumblr. At the same time, doesn't look like you guys are adding too many new features on top of what's already being built for Grumblr. I would say you guys need to think of more ideas to make this webapp more interesting. Integrating Google Wallet for the payment and Google Maps for the location is a good start, but you guys should look to add more another major feature or two that's not being done in Grumblr.
