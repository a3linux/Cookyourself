Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: c16e869bdc0bbd290240ca699e9c119d12930b69

Note: The grades for each section represent the completeness of your specification, and do not necessarily reflect how we judge the scope of your project. We still have concerns about the project being different enough from Grumblr - see the additional information section.

### The product backlog (10/10)

* I'm confused about how posts are created - there doesn't seem to be any way to post dishes.
* You should have included a clear assignment of responsibility for each feature, to the student or students on the team who will complete that feature. Each student should have sole responsibility for some features on the overall project.
* You should have included a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, you should consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (9/10)

* What is the purpose of the `CrawlerRecord` model? How does tracking a URL affect your app?
* Why does instruction have a foreign key to itself? Does an instruction have many other instructions?
* How is a shopping list stored?

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

### Additional Information

* I'm very concerned about a) the scope of the project and b) how you obtain data. The notion of posting dishes that can be commented on is very similar to grumblr. It also seems like most of the functionality in your site hinges upon being able to scrape data about meals, ingredients and store prices from other websites. This is not an easy task - especially the last part. Students generally have more success when their project doesn't rely on scraping data from unreliable sources.
